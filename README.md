# WhateverBot
A bot used in Whatever's Matrix rooms, with support for end-to-end encrypted messages

To set up your own bot built off of this, you need to make a .env file with the variables listed. For non-testing usage, I recommend using Docker.
Check out simplematrixbotlib's [docs](https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) to learn more.
